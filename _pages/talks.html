<h3>Bike-Share Ridership Prediction for Network Expansion Using Graph Neural Networks</h3>
<strong>Status:</strong> Under revision (Transportation Research Part A)<br>
<strong>Authors:</strong> Mohseni Hosseinabadi, G., Nourinejad, M., & Park, P.<br>

<strong>Abstract:</strong> 
Ridership prediction in station-based bike-sharing services improves station planning, fleet management, and network design. Ridership inflow and outflow prediction at the station level has received significant attention through trip production and attraction models. However, station-to-station ridership has been studied less, despite its widespread applications in use cases such as bike-lane planning or fleet electrification. This study introduces a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to model station-to-station ridership using a customized Graph Sample and Aggregate framework to generate node embeddings and minimize the weighted Mean Squared Error for peak periods. The model incorporates the characteristics of the network, sociodemographic features, and station properties. We present the case study of Bikeshare Toronto to train and test the GNN model and benchmark it against other standard prediction methods. We show that the GNN outperforms linear regression, spatial regression, XGBoost, and artificial neural networks due to its ability to capture the impact of the network structure on ridership patterns. We incorporate the GNN model in five design scenarios focusing on urban core connectivity, suburban access, transit integration, equitable accessibility, and tourist hubs. Each scenario is strategically developed to prioritize and address unique urban challenges. To enhance the model's application in real-world planning, we embedded the model in a web-based tool for the Cities of Vancouver and Toronto, allowing for further "what-if" scenario analysis in bike-sharing network planning.

<h3>Continuum Approximation of Facility Locations for Ridership Maximization in Station-Based Bike-sharing</h3>
<strong>Status:</strong> Under revision (Transportation Research Part C)<br>
<strong>Authors:</strong> Mohseni Hosseinabadi, G., Nourinejad, M., & Park, P.<br>

<strong>Abstract:</strong> 
Bike-sharing is an active transportation mode that can be used independently or jointly with other modes to offer first- and last-mile connectivity. Optimizing bike-sharing network expansion is complex, particularly when considering ridership maximization as an objective, which introduces network-level effects in the decision-making process. Discrete optimization methods become impractical for large-scale problems with numerous potential station locations, especially when detailed data on location properties is lacking. This study introduces a Continuum Approximation (CA) model with a force-based algorithm to configure the placement of bike-sharing stations that maximize the ridership. Unlike previous approaches focused primarily on accessibility, our model integrates ridership objectives into the CA framework, allowing stations to move freely across a continuous service area where origins and destinations are spatially distributed. The proposed algorithm extends the classic force-based facility location model by incorporating both repulsion and attraction forces to optimize station spacing and dynamically align station locations with high-demand areas. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the CA algorithm, delivering near-optimal solutions that enhance bike-sharing ridership. Sensitivity analysis further validates the adaptability of the model, revealing that optimizing station spacing and balancing interactions between inter-station and demand-to-station dynamics are crucial for overall system performance. The results identify an optimal parameter range that maximizes ridership while ensuring the model's responsiveness to varying demand densities and network sizes. Subsequently, to illustrate the practical applicability of this study approach, we apply the proposed CA model and algorithm to the real-world context of the Vancouver bike-sharing system.

<h3>Public Transportation Fleet Electrification and Charger Schedule Optimization Using a Decomposition Heuristic</h3>
<strong>Status:</strong> Published (Energy)<br>
<strong>Authors:</strong> Naeimian, B., Mohseni Hosseinabadi, G., Barzegari, V., Nourinejad, M., & Park, P.<br>
<strong>Abstract:</strong> 
Electric bus (E-bus) charging can occur overnight or en route during layovers, with the latter introducing challenges of limited competition for limited-capacity chargers. This paper presents an en route E-bus charging schedule optimization model, incorporating fleet characteristics, bus itinerary time windows, charging capacity and rate limitations, time-varying electricity prices, and partial charging capabilities. The objective function balances maximizing the number of electrified bus blocks with minimizing total charging costs.}
We develop a decomposition-based heuristic algorithm for large-scale networks with many bus blocks competing for chargers of limited outlet capacity. The decomposition algorithm solves the charging schedule problem for each bus individually and penalizes charger over-utilization, achieving near-optimal solutions more efficiently than exact methods. The model is evaluated using data from the General Transit Feed Specification of bus networks in Toronto, Vancouver, Washington, Manhattan, and the Bay Area. The results demonstrate the ability of the model to shift charging to lower-cost, off-peak hours and optimize charger utilization.}
Sensitivity analysis identifies battery size and minimum charge levels as critical factors influencing fleet electrification.

<h3>Optimizing Battery Swapping Operations in Shared E-Bike Systems</h3>
<strong>Status:</strong> Working paper<br>
<strong>Authors:</strong> Farschi Heydari, F., Mohseni Hosseinabadi, G., Nourinejad, M., & Park, P.<br>

<strong>Abstract:</strong> 
Shared electric bicycles (e-bikes) have become an integral component of urban transportation systems, offering a faster, more accessible alternative to conventional bicycles for short-distance travel. Their growing adoption has amplified the operational importance of maintaining adequate battery levels across distributed fleets. Among battery management strategies, battery swapping, replacing depleted batteries with fully charged ones, offers a promising solution, particularly for dockless systems lacking fixed charging infrastructure. However, this approach introduces substantial logistical challenges, including the efficient delivery of charged batteries, timely retrieval of depleted ones, and route planning under vehicle capacity constraints.
In this study, we propose an optimization framework for battery swapping in dockless e-bike-sharing systems that integrates dynamic clustering with a vehicle routing model. The framework first partitions e-bikes in need of battery swaps into serviceable clusters based on state of charge (SOC), spatial proximity, and available fleet resources. Each cluster is designed to be feasible for a single van to service. A dual-objective optimization model is then applied to each cluster, simultaneously minimizing travel distance and maximizing economic return. By iteratively refining cluster boundaries and routing assignments, the model improves operational efficiency while ensuring balanced resource utilization. The framework is evaluated using real-time data from the Bay Wheels system in San Francisco, accessed through the General Bikeshare Feed Specification (GBFS). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant reductions in travel distance and improves the profitability of battery-swapping operations.
