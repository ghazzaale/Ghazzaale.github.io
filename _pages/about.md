I recently defended my PhD in Transportation Engineering at York University. I also lead R&D at the <a href="https://interactive-or.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interactive-OR Lab</a> while continuing as a Post-Doctoral Fellow. My work translates advanced data science and optimization into deployable planning tools for cities, agencies, and startups. I design, build, and ship interactive decision-support systems on the cloud using AWS, Firebase, WebAssembly, and Mapbox; always with a focus on measurable impact, equity, and user-centered design. 
<!-- I am a PhD candidate in Transportation Engineering at York University, affiliated with the <a href="https://interactive-or.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interactive-OR Lab</a>. I have been fortunate to work under the supervision of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mehdi-nourinejad-a0040843/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Mehdi Nourinejad</a> (supervisor), who is also an Amazon Scholar, and Dr. Peter Park (co-supervisor).  
My research focuses on shared micromobility systems, particularly the design and optimization of bike-sharing and e-bike networks. I work at the intersection of data science, optimization, and transportation systems, developing models and tools that support sustainable, equitable, and operationally viable mobility solutions. -->

My PhD thesis was focused on shared micromobility systems, particularly the design and optimization of bike-sharing and e-bike networks. This research laid the foundation for <strong>Bikeshare Pro</strong>, a web-based decision-support tool that helps cities and operators plan bike-share expansion, charger deployment, and multimodal integration. Along the way, I applied advanced methods in machine learning and optimization, including Graph Neural Networks for ridership prediction, force-based algorithms for station placement, and Markovian models for e-bike charging. Beyond micromobility, I’ve also led projects in electric bus charging, automated speed enforcement, emergency response planning, and urban service logistics.
