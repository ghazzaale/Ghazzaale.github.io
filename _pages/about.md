Hi there! 

<div style="text-align: justify;">
I am a PhD candidate in Transportation Engineering at the York University working under supervision of [Dr. Mehdi Nourinejad](https://interactive-or.net/team) and Dr.Peter Park. My PhD research thesis focuses on data-driven bike-share network optimization, exploring the intersections of sustainability, economic efficiency, and equity in micro-mobility planning. My academic journey began with a Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering, followed by a Master's degree in Transportation Systems Engineering.</div>
</br>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Alongside this, I develop advanced data analysis, visualization, and planning tools that incorporate principles from Machine Learning and Operations Research, aimed at improving decision-making in the transportation sector. In addition to my doctoral research, I engage in various side projects including but not limited to:</div>
</br>

*Multimodal transportation, </br>
*Electrification of transportation systems (public and private),</br>

*Automated speed enforcement,</br>

*Parking planning,</br>

</br>

A brief summary of each project can be found in the Portfolio section of this website.
