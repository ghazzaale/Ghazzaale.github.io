<p>I hold a PhD in Transportation Engineering from York University and lead R&D at the <a href="https://interactive-or.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interactive-OR Lab</a> while continuing as a Post-Doctoral Fellow. My work bridges advanced data science and optimization models with real-world applications, resulting in deployable planning tools for cities, public agencies, and startups. I design, build, and deliver interactive, cloud-based decision-support systems using AWS, Firebase, WebAssembly, and Mapbox, guided by principles of measurable impact, equity, and user-centered design.</p>



<p>My PhD thesis was focused on shared micromobility systems, particularly the design and optimization of bike-sharing and e-bike networks. This research laid the foundation for <strong>Bikeshare Pro</strong>, a web-based decision-support tool that helps cities and operators plan bike-share expansion, charger deployment, and multimodal integration. Along the way, I applied advanced methods in machine learning and optimization, including Graph Neural Networks for ridership prediction, force-based algorithms for station placement, and Markovian models for e-bike charging. Beyond micromobility, I've also led projects in electric bus charging, automated speed enforcement, emergency response planning, and urban service logistics.</p>

<p><strong>Bikeshare Pro</strong> has been recognized for its innovation and real-world impact, earning several distinctions: it was selected as a semi-finalist for the <a href="https://www.informs.org/Recognizing-Excellence/Community-Prizes/Analytics-Society/Innovative-Applications-in-Analytics-Award?__cf_chl_tk=9EvoK.6b6ftK3uoComC6aXL3K_PWigAS7E4TNRYzwT0-1740061488-1.0.1.1-f3EgqQsmiT3oSkrJukG3pdvvMZVFQxHUpyHmzvVT1.M" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>INFORMS Innovative Applications in Analytics Award (IAAA)</em></a> in 2025, was named a finalist in the 2024 <a href="https://www.trb-transit-mgmt-perf.org/annual-meetings/transit-data-challenge#h.gkd0sehzwsz9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Transit Data Challenge</em></a> organized by the Transportation Research Board (TRB), and received the <a href="https://lassonde.yorku.ca/ghazaleh-mohseni-receives-the-2023-innovation-of-the-year-award-from-the-institute-of-transportation-engineers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Innovation Award of the Year</em></a> (2023) from the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE). My work has also been recognized with the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/wts-canadian-education-foundation_from-may-79-more-than-1000-attendees-convened-activity-7328524515179655169-T8Yy?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAABTHrvgBk17mK_BgkAwln-q4XYMZo5fgSJw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>WTS Accessible Communities Scholarship</em></a>, presented at the 2025 WTS International Conference, reflecting my commitment to inclusive and community-centered mobility planning.</p>

<p>
In Interactive-OR, we have been working closely with public agencies through applied collaborations and pilots. Most recently, this includes an active collaboration with the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC), where a pilot focused on real-time transit analytics and decision support was launched on November 18, 2025. This pilot translates research into operational practice and informs ongoing development, with further collaborations currently in progress. The project has also been recognized as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/itetoronto_ttc-itetoronto-transportation-activity-7409620649620496384-gh2R?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAABTHrvgBk17mK_BgkAwln-q4XYMZo5fgSJw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>the Project of the Year by ITE Toronto. </em></a> Additional details and related tools can be found in the Portfolio section.
