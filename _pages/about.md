<div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 20px;">

I am a PhD candidate in Transportation Engineering at York University, affiliated with the <a href="https://interactive-or.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <em>Interactive-OR Lab</em></a>. I have been fortunate to work under the supervision of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mehdi-nourinejad-a0040843/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Mehdi Nourinejad</a> (supervisor), who is also an Amazon Scholar, and Dr. Peter Park (co-supervisor).  My research focuses on shared micromobility systems, particularly the design and optimization of bike-sharing and e-bike networks. I work at the intersection of data science, optimization, and transportation systems, developing models and tools that support sustainable, equitable, and operationally viable mobility solutions.

My work integrates advanced techniques, including Graph Neural Networks for ridership prediction, Continuum Approximation and force-based algorithms for station placement, and two-dimensional Markovian models for e-bike charging and relocation. These methodologies form the foundation of <strong>Bikeshare Pro</strong>, a web-based decision-support tool I developed to help cities and operators optimize bike-share expansion, charger deployment, and multimodal integration. Rooted in my doctoral research, Bikeshare Pro translates academic insights into practical, data-driven solutions.

<strong>Bikeshare Pro</strong> has been recognized for its innovation and real-world impact, earning several distinctions: it was selected as a semi-finalist for the <a href="https://www.informs.org/Recognizing-Excellence/Community-Prizes/Analytics-Society/Innovative-Applications-in-Analytics-Award?__cf_chl_tk=9EvoK.6b6ftK3uoComC6aXL3K_PWigAS7E4TNRYzwT0-1740061488-1.0.1.1-f3EgqQsmiT3oSkrJukG3pdvvMZVFQxHUpyHmzvVT1.M" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>INFORMS Innovative Applications in Analytics Award (IAAA)</em></a> in 2025, was named a finalist in the 2024 <a href="https://www.trb-transit-mgmt-perf.org/annual-meetings/transit-data-challenge#h.gkd0sehzwsz9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Transit Data Challenge</em></a> organized by the Transportation Research Board (TRB), and received the <a href="https://lassonde.yorku.ca/ghazaleh-mohseni-receives-the-2023-innovation-of-the-year-award-from-the-institute-of-transportation-engineers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Innovation Award of the Year</em></a> (2023) from the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE). My work has also been recognized with the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/wts-canadian-education-foundation_from-may-79-more-than-1000-attendees-convened-activity-7328524515179655169-T8Yy?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAABTHrvgBk17mK_BgkAwln-q4XYMZo5fgSJw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>WTS Accessible Communities Scholarship</em></a>, presented at the 2025 WTS International Conference, reflecting my commitment to inclusive and community-centered mobility planning.

Beyond micromobility, I’ve led and contributed to diverse projects in electric bus charging, automated enforcement, emergency response planning, and urban service logistics, among others. I regularly collaborate with public agencies, startups, and researchers to develop advanced optimization models and turn them into actionable, interactive planning tools — hosted on the cloud and deployed through web interfaces using technologies like AWS, Firebase, WebAssembly, and Mapbox.
