Hi there! 


I am a PhD candidate in Transportation Engineering at the York University working under supervision of [Dr. Mehdi Nourinejad](https://interactive-or.net/team) and Dr.Peter Park. My PhD research thesis focuses on data-driven bike-share network optimization, exploring the intersections of sustainability, economic efficiency, and equity in micro-mobility planning. My academic journey began with a Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering, followed by a Master's degree in Transportation Systems Engineering.

Alongside this, I develop advanced data analysis, visualization, and planning tools that incorporate principles from Machine Learning and Operations Research, aimed at improving decision-making in the transportation sector. In addition to my doctoral research, I engage in various side projects including the electrification of transportation systems, automated speed enforcement, and optimizing last-mile logistics. A brief summary of each project can be found in the Projects section of this website.

In my free time, I enjoy playing online games and reading, particularly fiction.

Let's connect if you have any feedback or new idea!
